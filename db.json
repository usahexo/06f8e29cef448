It is the tenth day of the Dhu al-Hijjah lunar month.\n\nEid al-Adha celebrates Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son Isaac, as God had commanded him. Muslims commemorate this story by sacrificing animals, usually sheep or cows, and giving some of the meat to the poor.\n\n#  What is the Islamic calendar?\n\nThe Islamic calendar, also known as the Hijri calendar, is a lunar calendar used by Muslims to mark religious occasions. It is based on the hijrah, or journey of the Prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Medina in 622 AD.\n\nThe Islamic calendar has 12 months, each lasting 29 or 30 days. The first month, Muharram, begins with the first sighting of the new moon. The remaining months are: Safar, Rabi' al-awwal, Rabi' ath-thani, Jumada al-ula', Jumada al-akhirah, Rajab, Sha'ban, Ramadan, Shawwal and Dhu al-Qi'dah.\n\nThe Islamic year is 10 or 11 days shorter than the Gregorian year. This means that Islamic holidays fall at different times each year in relation to the Gregorian calendar. For example, Ramadan typically falls in late May or early June on the Gregorian calendar.\n\n#  How do Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha?\n\nThe Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha is always celebrated on the tenth day of the Dhu al-Hijjah lunar month. For Muslims, this holiday commemorates Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son Ishmael as an act of obedience to God. Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha by attending special prayer services, exchanging gifts and blessings with family and friends, and slaughtering livestock in commemoration of Ibrahim's sacrifice.\n\nMany Muslims also take part in the tradition of Qurbani, which involves sacrificing a goat, sheep, cow or camel in memory of Ibrahim's sacrifice. The meat from the Qurbani is usually distributed among friends, family members and the poor. In some cases, it is also saved for the time of Hajj, when Muslims are able to feast on the meat after completing the pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\n# How do non-Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha?\n\nNon-Muslims may not be familiar with all the specifics of how Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha, but they can still join in on some of the festivities. One common way to mark the holiday is by giving to charity. Many people choose to donate money or food to local mosques or homeless shelters during Eid al-Adha. Some families also gather together to cook large meals comprising traditional dishes like lamb or beef biriyani. Finally, many people like to dress up in their best clothes and attend special prayers at a mosque or community center.\n\n#  Why do Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha?\n\nThe Muslim Eid al-Adha is a religious holiday celebrated by Muslims all over the world to commemorate Ibrahim’s willingness to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to Allah. The holiday falls on the 10th day of the Islamic month Dhul-Hijjah and lasts for four days. It is one of the two most important holidays in Islam, the other being Eid al-Fitr.\n\nOn the first day of Eid al-Adha, Muslims attend a special prayer service known as Salat al-Eid. The prayers are followed by a sermon and then a celebration with food and family. Muslims are also encouraged to perform charitable deeds during Eid al-Adha. These include helping the poor and needy, feeding animals, and repairing roads and bridges.\n\nThe significance of Eid al-Adha comes from three main sources. The first is from Ibrahim’s story in the Quran. The second is from hadiths, which are oral traditions attributed to the Prophet Muhammad. And finally, there are scholarly opinions that look at both the Quran and hadiths to derive meaning.\n\nOne of the most famous stories from the Quran about Ibrahim is when Allah commands him to sacrifice his only son Ismael as an act of submission to Him. Ibrahim was willing to do anything for Allah, so he prepared to carry out Allah’s command. However, at the last moment Allah replaced Ismael with a ram, sparing his son’s life. This story represents how obedient Ibrahim was to Allah and how much he loved Him.\n\nEid al-Adha celebrates this story by commemorating Ibrahim’s willingness to give up everything for Allah—including his own son. Muslims celebrate this holiday by giving charity, praying together, and praising Allah for His blessings.\n\n#  What are some of the traditions associated with Eid al-Adha?\n\nThe Eid al-Adha (Festival of Sacrifice) is a Muslim holiday that commemorates the willingness of Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son, Ishmael, as an act of obedience to God. It is one of the two most important holidays in the Islamic calendar, and it falls on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the 12th and final month of the Islamic lunar calendar.\n\nMuslims typically celebrate Eid al-Adha by attending morning prayers at a mosque, followed by visits with family and friends. They may also enjoy special foods such as biryani or khichdi, or give charity to those in need. In many parts of the world, goats or sheep are sacrificed as part of this holiday celebration. The meat from the animals is usually divided into three parts: One for the family, one for friends and relatives, and one for the poor and needy.\n\n# What are some things you can do to celebrate Eid al-Adha?\n\nThere are many things you can do to celebrate Eid al-Adha. Some people may choose to go to a mosque for morning prayers, while others may prefer to stay home and spend time with family. You can also enjoy traditional foods like biryani or khichdi, or give charity to those in need. If you live in a country where livestock is sacrificed as part of the celebration, you may want to visit a local market or farm to see all the action!","source":"_posts/When-is-Eid-al-Adha-2022.md","raw":"---\ntitle: When is Eid al Adha 2022\ndate: 2022-09-17 18:37:46\ncategories:\n- Eid al-Fitr\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  When is Eid al-Adha 2022?\n\nThe Islamic holy day of Eid al-Adha is on Wednesday, September 12, 2022.

The first month, Muharram, begins with the first sighting of the new moon. The remaining months are: Safar, Rabi' al-awwal, Rabi' ath-thani, Jumada al-ula', Jumada al-akhirah, Rajab, Sha'ban, Ramadan, Shawwal and Dhu al-Qi'dah.\n\nThe Islamic year is 10 or 11 days shorter than the Gregorian year. This means that Islamic holidays fall at different times each year in relation to the Gregorian calendar. For example, Ramadan typically falls in late May or early June on the Gregorian calendar.\n\n#  How do Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha?\n\nThe Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha is always celebrated on the tenth day of the Dhu al-Hijjah lunar month. For Muslims, this holiday commemorates Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son Ishmael as an act of obedience to God. Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha by attending special prayer services, exchanging gifts and blessings with family and friends, and slaughtering livestock in commemoration of Ibrahim's sacrifice.\n\nMany Muslims also take part in the tradition of Qurbani, which involves sacrificing a goat, sheep, cow or camel in memory of Ibrahim's sacrifice. The meat from the Qurbani is usually distributed among friends, family members and the poor. In some cases, it is also saved for the time of Hajj, when Muslims are able to feast on the meat after completing the pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\n# How do non-Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha?\n\nNon-Muslims may not be familiar with all the specifics of how Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha, but they can still join in on some of the festivities. One common way to mark the holiday is by giving to charity. Many people choose to donate money or food to local mosques or homeless shelters during Eid al-Adha. Some families also gather together to cook large meals comprising traditional dishes like lamb or beef biriyani. Finally, many people like to dress up in their best clothes and attend special prayers at a mosque or community center.\n\n#  Why do Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha?\n\nThe Muslim Eid al-Adha is a religious holiday celebrated by Muslims all over the world to commemorate Ibrahim’s willingness to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to Allah. The holiday falls on the 10th day of the Islamic month Dhul-Hijjah and lasts for four days. It is one of the two most important holidays in Islam, the other being Eid al-Fitr.\n\nOn the first day of Eid al-Adha, Muslims attend a special prayer service known as Salat al-Eid. The prayers are followed by a sermon and then a celebration with food and family. Muslims are also encouraged to perform charitable deeds during Eid al-Adha. These include helping the poor and needy, feeding animals, and repairing roads and bridges.\n\nThe significance of Eid al-Adha comes from three main sources. The first is from Ibrahim’s story in the Quran. The second is from hadiths, which are oral traditions attributed to the Prophet Muhammad. And finally, there are scholarly opinions that look at both the Quran and hadiths to derive meaning.\n\nOne of the most famous stories from the Quran about Ibrahim is when Allah commands him to sacrifice his only son Ismael as an act of submission to Him. Ibrahim was willing to do anything for Allah, so he prepared to carry out Allah’s command. However, at the last moment Allah replaced Ismael with a ram, sparing his son’s life. This story represents how obedient Ibrahim was to Allah and how much he loved Him.\n\nEid al-Adha celebrates this story by commemorating Ibrahim’s willingness to give up everything for Allah—including his own son. Muslims celebrate this holiday by giving charity, praying together, and praising Allah for His blessings.\n\n#  What are some of the traditions associated with Eid al-Adha?\n\nThe Eid al-Adha (Festival of Sacrifice) is a Muslim holiday that commemorates the willingness of Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son, Ishmael, as an act of obedience to God. It is one of the two most important holidays in the Islamic calendar, and it falls on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the 12th and final month of the Islamic lunar calendar.\n\nMuslims typically celebrate Eid al-Adha by attending morning prayers at a mosque, followed by visits with family and friends. They may also enjoy special foods such as biryani or khichdi, or give charity to those in need. In many parts of the world, goats or sheep are sacrificed as part of this holiday celebration. The meat from the animals is usually divided into three parts: One for the family, one for friends and relatives, and one for the poor and needy.\n\n# What are some things you can do to celebrate Eid al-Adha?\n\nThere are many things you can do to celebrate Eid al-Adha. Some people may choose to go to a mosque for morning prayers, while others may prefer to stay home and spend time with family. You can also enjoy traditional foods like biryani or khichdi, or give charity to those in need. If you live in a country where livestock is sacrificed as part of the celebration, you may want to visit a local market or farm to see all the action!","slug":"When-is-Eid-al-Adha-2022","published":1,"updated":"2022-09-17T10:37:46.982Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cl85s03u3000024v5620p3ks4","content":"<h1 id=\"When-is-Eid-al-Adha-2022\"><a href=\"#When-is-Eid-al-Adha-2022\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"When is Eid al-Adha 2022?\"></a>When is Eid al-Adha 2022?</h1><p>The Islamic holy day of Eid al-Adha is on Wednesday, September 12, 2022.

What is the next move for each company?\n\nLeoVegas Casino has announced a partnership with English Premier League club Manchester City. The partnership will see LeoVegas become the \"Official Gaming Partner\" of Manchester City and will include opportunities such as player appearances, LED stadium perimeter branding, and exclusive content and promotions.\n\nParis Saint-Germain has announced a partnership with betting company Betfair. The partnership will see Betfair become the \"Official Betting Partner\" of Paris Saint-Germain and will include opportunities such as player appearances, LED stadium perimeter branding, and exclusive content and promotions.\n\nPlaton has announced a partnership with French football club Olympique Lyonnais. The partnership will see Platon become the \"Official Photo Partner\" of Olympique Lyonnais and will include opportunities such as player appearances, LED stadium perimeter branding, and exclusive content and promotions.\n\n#  How will LeoVegas Casino, Paris Saint-Germain, and Platon benefit from this new agreement?\n\nThe impending deal between LeoVegas Casino, Paris Saint-Germain, and Platon has fans and experts alike speculating about the potential benefits that all three could reap from the partnership.\n\nLeoVegas Casino is a global gaming company with a strong presence in Europe. The company is expected to gain some much-needed exposure in North America through its affiliation with Paris Saint-Germain. In turn, Paris Saint-Germain will enjoy increased revenues from merchandising and sponsorship opportunities. This new agreement could also help Platon capture a larger market share for its sports photography services.\n\nSome experts are already predicting that the deal will make LeoVegas Casino the official betting partner of Paris Saint-Germain. If this proves to be true, it would give the casino even more exposure in major media outlets around the world. It's also worth mentioning that LeoVegas is one of the few companies to have a partnership with both a Premier League team and a major European soccer club.\n\nThis new agreement is a big win for all involved parties. For LeoVegas Casino, it's an opportunity to expand its reach into new markets. For Paris Saint-Germain, it's a way to bolster its bottom line by securing additional revenue streams. And for Platon, it's a chance to showcase its photographic services to a wider audience.\n\n#  What impact will this new agreement have on each company's bottom line?\n\nThe new agreement between ABC Corp and DEF Corp is expected to have a positive impact on both companies' bottom lines. ABC Corp is forecast to see an increase in revenue of 10 percent, while DEF Corp is expected to save 5 percent on costs.\n\nThe new agreement is a result of the two companies' previous partnership going sour. ABC Corp was contracted to provide manufacturing services to DEF Corp, but the quality of the products began to suffer as the deadline for delivery neared. This resulted in DEF Corp having to pay a penalty for late delivery.\n\nUnder the new agreement, ABC Corp will continue to provide manufacturing services, but DEF Corp will now have exclusive rights to market and sell the products. This will give DEF Corp more control over the quality of the products and ensure that they are delivered on time. It will also allow DEF Corp to earn higher profits by selling the products at a higher price.\n\nThe new agreement is expected to have a positive impact on both companies' bottom lines. ABC Corp is forecast to see an increase in revenue of 10 percent, while DEF Corp is expected to save 5 percent on costs.\n\n#  What are the primary advantages of this new agreement for each party involved?\n\nThe new TPP agreement has many benefits for all the parties involved. For Canada, it opens up new markets for our goods and services, while protecting our intellectual property. It also helps us to keep up with other countries who have already signed the agreement.\n\nFor Japan, it strengthens relationships with Canada and the United States, while also giving them access to new markets. The agreement also allows them to protect their intellectual property more effectively.\n\nFor the United States, it strengthens relationships with Japan and Canada, as well as with other nations in the region. It also gives them more access to these markets, which will help to boost the economy.\n\n\n\n#  How does this new partnership further the goals of each company?\n\nOn March 26, 2019, it was announced that Google had partnered with the Prince Hotel in Japan. The purpose of this partnership is to improve the accuracy of information provided by Google Maps. It is hoped that this new partnership will further the goals of each company.\n\nGoogle has been collecting data since 2005 to improve the accuracy of its maps. However, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have allowed the company to improve the accuracy of its maps at a much faster pace. The Prince Hotel has been working closely with Google over the past few years to provide it with high-quality data.\n\nThis new partnership will allow Google to access even more data from the Prince Hotel. In addition, the Prince Hotel will be able to use Google’s artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to improve its own services. It is hoped that this new partnership will help both companies achieve their goals.","source":"_posts/What-is-the-next-move-for-LeoVegas-Casino,-Paris-Saint-Germain,-and-Platon.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What is the next move for LeoVegas Casino, Paris Saint Germain, and Platon\ndate: 2022-09-22 18:56:37\ncategories:\n- Virtual Sports\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What is the next move for LeoVegas Casino, Paris Saint-Germain, and Platon?\n\nAs of July 1, 2019, LeoVegas Casino, Paris Saint-Germain, and Platon have all announced new partnerships.
