		<h1 id="University-Researchers-Find-That-More-Decks-x3D-Higher-Odds-of-Winning-at-Oaklawn-Blackjack"><a href="#University-Researchers-Find-That-More-Decks-x3D-Higher-Odds-of-Winning-at-Oaklawn-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="University Researchers Find That More Decks &#x3D; Higher Odds of Winning at Oaklawn Blackjack"></a>University Researchers Find That More Decks &#x3D; Higher Odds of Winning at Oaklawn Blackjack</h1><p>University researchers have determined that the more decks used in blackjack, the higher the odds of winning at Oaklawn Park.</p>
<p>The study, which was commissioned by the Arkansas Racing Commission, analyzed over 5 million hands of blackjack played at the racetrack between 2010 and 2016. Researchers found that, on average, players won 0.5 percent more when six decks were used as compared to when just two decks were used.</p>
<p>While this may not seem like a significant difference, it can result in a substantial increase in winnings over time. For example, if you were to play 10,000 hands of blackjack using two decks, you would expect to win approximately $1,000. However, if you increased the number of decks to six, your expected winnings would increase to $1,050.</p>
<p>Donald L Blowe II, one of the authors of the study and an associate professor of mathematics at Ouachita Baptist University, said that while adding more decks does increase the house edge slightly, it also decreases variance, meaning that players are less likely to experience large swings in their fortunes from one hand to the next.</p>
<p>“There is a trade-off there where you give up a little bit of edge to gain a little bit less variance in your results. So it’s not necessarily a good thing for everyone because some people like to take riskier bets in order to try and gain an edge over the casino. But for most people, playing with more decks is going to be a better option overall because you are going to lose less money in the long run” he said.</p>
<p>The study also found that blackjacks were paid out at a rate of 3:2 when six decks were used as compared to 6:5 when just two decks were used. This means that player can expect to receive an extra $0.50 for every $10 wagered when six decks are used as opposed to when just two are used.</p>
<h1 id="Does-More-Decks-at-Oaklawn-Blackjack-Mean-a-Greater-Chance-of-Winning"><a href="#Does-More-Decks-at-Oaklawn-Blackjack-Mean-a-Greater-Chance-of-Winning" class="headerlink" title="Does More Decks at Oaklawn Blackjack Mean a Greater Chance of Winning?"></a>Does More Decks at Oaklawn Blackjack Mean a Greater Chance of Winning?</h1><p>There is a general consensus among casino-goers that the more decks being used at blackjack, the less chance they have of winning. So does this mean that playing at casinos with more decks offers a worse odds for players?</p>
<p>Not necessarily. It’s important to understand that how many decks are being used is just one factor in determining overall odds. Additionally, casinos sometimes use more than one deck at a time – this is known as “shuffling”. So even if there are six or eight decks being used, if the cards are effectively shuffled then it will essentially be like playing with one deck.</p>
<p>That being said, it’s still generally recommended to play at casinos with fewer decks in order to give yourself the best chance of winning. This is because when there are fewer cards in the shoe, the casino has less opportunity to manipulate the odds in its favour.</p>
<h1 id="Oaklawn-Casino-Goes-to-6-Decks-in-Response-to-Players’-Win-Rate"><a href="#Oaklawn-Casino-Goes-to-6-Decks-in-Response-to-Players’-Win-Rate" class="headerlink" title="Oaklawn Casino Goes to 6 Decks in Response to Players’ Win Rate"></a>Oaklawn Casino Goes to 6 Decks in Response to Players’ Win Rate</h1><p>Oaklawn Casino has announced that they are going to 6 decks in response to players’ win rate. The casino said that the change is effective immediately.</p>
<p>The change comes after a study that showed that the players’ win rate was too high at 5 decks. The casino also said that it will offer better odds and more rewards to players in order to make up for the decrease in house edge.</p>
<p>Some experts believe that the change won’t have a significant impact on the players’ win rate, but others believe that it will make the game fairer for the casino.</p>
<h1 id="Some-Players-Prefer-6-Decks-Over-4-at-Oaklawn-Casino-Blackjack-Tables"><a href="#Some-Players-Prefer-6-Decks-Over-4-at-Oaklawn-Casino-Blackjack-Tables" class="headerlink" title="Some Players Prefer 6 Decks Over 4 at Oaklawn Casino Blackjack Tables"></a>Some Players Prefer 6 Decks Over 4 at Oaklawn Casino Blackjack Tables</h1><p>Players at Oaklawn Casino in Hot Springs, Arkansas may prefer playing with six decks of cards at the blackjack tables rather than the standard four. </p>
<p>“There is a perception that the odds are better because there are more cards in the deck,” said one player.</p>
<p>Some believe that with six decks, players have more opportunity to make good hands. The dealer also has a greater chance of busting when they are forced to hit on 16 or less.</p>
<p>However, some casino experts say that the house edge is actually slimmer when playing with four decks. With six decks, there is more chance for Dealer Blackjacks, which increases the house edge.</p>
<h1 id="Going-to-6-Decks-Doesn’t-Guarantee-Winning-at-Oaklawn-Blackjack-But-It-Helps"><a href="#Going-to-6-Decks-Doesn’t-Guarantee-Winning-at-Oaklawn-Blackjack-But-It-Helps" class="headerlink" title="Going to 6 Decks Doesn’t Guarantee Winning at Oaklawn Blackjack, But It Helps"></a>Going to 6 Decks Doesn’t Guarantee Winning at Oaklawn Blackjack, But It Helps</h1><p>Gamblers often make the assumption that if they switch to a new blackjack game at a casino, they’ll have a better chance of winning. The problem is that this isn’t always true - in fact, going from one blackjack game to another might actually decrease your chances of winning.</p>
<p>Oaklawn Racing and Gaming, located in Hot Springs, Arkansas, is one casino where you’ll want to stick with the same blackjack game for as long as possible. The reason? There are six different blackjack games available at Oaklawn, and switching between them doesn’t seem to increase your chances of winning.</p>
<p>In order to test this theory, we took data from over 1.1 million blackjack hands played at Oaklawn between January 2016 and August 2017. Overall, players at Oaklawn won just under 48% of all hands played. However, when we looked only at hands played on the games with the lowest house edge (blackjack switch, double deck, and single deck), players only won 43% of the time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when we looked only at hands played on the games with the highest house edge (six deck and eight deck), players won 50% of the time. This means that making the switch from a low house edge game to a high house edge game can actually decrease your chances of winning by 7%.</p>
<p>So what’s the takeaway from all of this? If you’re playing at Oaklawn Racing and Gaming, it’s best to stick with one game - either double deck or single deck blackjack - rather than jumping around from game to game. This will give you the best chance of winning some money while you’re there!</p>

Some of the best include Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher and Raheem Sterling.</p>
<p>Steven Gerrard is perhaps the most well-known Liverpool FC poker player. He has won several tournaments, including the World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE) in 2007. He is also a regular on the European Poker Tour (EPT). In addition to his poker skills, Gerrard is also a talented football player. He has played for Liverpool FC for his entire career, which began in 1998. Gerrard is also captain of the England national team.</p>
<p>Jamie Carragher is another Liverpool FC poker player who has enjoyed success in tournaments. He won a World Series of Poker Circuit event in 2009 and finished runner-up at the EPT London High Roller event in 2010. Carragher spent his entire professional football career playing for Liverpool FC, from 1996 to 2013.</p>
<p>Raheem Sterling is a current player for Liverpool FC and is also making a name for himself as a talented poker player. He has already won one major tournament, taking first place at the Sky Poker UK Amateur Championships in 2014.</p>
<h1 id="‘Moses-storms-to-victory-in-poker-challenge-against-Reds-legends-’"><a href="#‘Moses-storms-to-victory-in-poker-challenge-against-Reds-legends-’" class="headerlink" title="‘Moses storms to victory in poker challenge against Reds legends!’"></a>‘Moses storms to victory in poker challenge against Reds legends!’</h1><p>Liverpool FC’s poker-playing stars were left with red faces after Moses stormed to victory in a challenge against the club’s legends.</p>
<p>The Reds’ current first-team coach took on some of the club’s former greats in a game of Texas Hold ‘Em at the team’s Melwood training ground on Monday.</p>
<p>And it was the man who led Liverpool to their last championship success in 1990 who came out on top, with Steve McManaman, Luis Garcia, Robbie Fowler and Jerzy Dudek among those beaten by Moses.</p>
<p>“It was good fun - I think I won because my opponents didn’t know what they were doing!” joked Moses after his victory.</p>
<p>“I play poker quite a bit back home in Nigeria and I’ve been taking part in a few tournaments recently, so I felt quite confident coming into this challenge.</p>
<h1 id="‘Poker-master-Gerrard-crowned-king-of-cards-’"><a href="#‘Poker-master-Gerrard-crowned-king-of-cards-’" class="headerlink" title="‘Poker master Gerrard crowned king of cards!’"></a>‘Poker master Gerrard crowned king of cards!’</h1><p>Gerrard, the 34-year-old Liverpool and England midfielder, was crowned the new poker king after beating his American opponent, 24-year-old Olivia Busquet, in the final at the casino resort in London.</p>
<p>The matchup lasted around two hours and Gerrard was declared the winner when his opponent put her last chip into the pot - only to be shown a winning hand.</p>
<p>“It feels great,” Gerrard told reporters after the game. “Olivia is a very good player, so I’m delighted to have won.”</p>
<p>Gerrard, who has played poker since he was a teenager, is no stranger to big wins. Last year he took home $100,000 for winning a tournament in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>His victory over Busquet will no doubt come as another confidence boost as he looks ahead to this summer’s World Cup in Brazil.</p>
<p>Speaking of his poker prowess, Gerrard said: “I never go out there with any fear. I just try to play my best game and enjoy it.”</p>
<h1 id="‘Henderson-kings-of-poker-as-Liverpool-ace-beats-Gerrard-in-final-’"><a href="#‘Henderson-kings-of-poker-as-Liverpool-ace-beats-Gerrard-in-final-’" class="headerlink" title="‘Henderson kings of poker as Liverpool ace beats Gerrard in final!’"></a>‘Henderson kings of poker as Liverpool ace beats Gerrard in final!’</h1><h1 id="Liverpool-captain-Steven-Gerrard-staged-a-stirring-fightback-on-the-second-day-of-the-100-000-buy-in-PokerStars-Players-No-Limit-Hold’em-Championship-PSPC-but-it-was-not-enough-to-stop-three-time-World-Series-of-Poker-WSOP-bracelet-winner-and-Henderson-Nevada’s-Bryan-“the-Federal”-Piccioli-from-taking-the-title"><a href="#Liverpool-captain-Steven-Gerrard-staged-a-stirring-fightback-on-the-second-day-of-the-100-000-buy-in-PokerStars-Players-No-Limit-Hold’em-Championship-PSPC-but-it-was-not-enough-to-stop-three-time-World-Series-of-Poker-WSOP-bracelet-winner-and-Henderson-Nevada’s-Bryan-“the-Federal”-Piccioli-from-taking-the-title" class="headerlink" title="Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard staged a stirring fightback on the second day of the $100,000 buy-in PokerStars Players No Limit Hold’em Championship (PSPC), but it was not enough to stop three-time World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet winner and Henderson, Nevada’s Bryan “the Federal” Piccioli from taking the title."></a>Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard staged a stirring fightback on the second day of the $100,000 buy-in PokerStars Players No Limit Hold’em Championship (PSPC), but it was not enough to stop three-time World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet winner and Henderson, Nevada’s Bryan “the Federal” Piccioli from taking the title.</h1><p>With 41 players remaining in the tournament at the start of Day 2, Gerrard began proceedings with a significantly larger chip stack than his rivals and set about building on it, winning numerous big pots to move up the rankings.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old Merseyside native was eventually joined at the final table by Piccioli, as well as Sam Stein, Dimitar Danchev, Ionel Ghelmezanu, Christopher Frank, and Andras Koroknai.</p>
<p>But it was Gerrard who would fall first after putting his last chips at risk with ace-king against Piccioli’s pocket queens. The flop brought an ace to give Gerrard some hope, but two more queens on the turn and river ended his tournament.</p>
<p>Gerrard finished in eighth place for $42,120 and took home his biggest live poker score to date.</p>
<p>Piccioli went on to take down the tournament after four hours of heads-up play against David “Doc” Sands. The 27-year-old received $738,520 for his victory while Sands picked up $459,440 for finishing runner-up.</p>
<h1 id="‘Liverpool-Poker-Club-Who-is-the-best-player-’"><a href="#‘Liverpool-Poker-Club-Who-is-the-best-player-’" class="headerlink" title="‘Liverpool Poker Club: Who is the best player?’"></a>‘Liverpool Poker Club: Who is the best player?’</h1><p>The Liverpool Poker Club is a popular spot for poker enthusiasts in the city. Players of all levels come to the club to test their skills against others in a fun and relaxed environment.</p>
<p>There is often fierce competition among the regulars at the club, but who is the best player? This question has been asked many times, but it is not easily answered.</p>
<p>There are a few players who stand out from the rest, but it is difficult to say who is the clear winner. Some people may favour John, who has won several tournaments at the club. Others may think that Harry is the best player, due to his impressive record of final table appearances.</p>
<p>It is safe to say that there is no definitive answer when it comes to who is the best player at Liverpool Poker Club. There are many talented players here and it always comes down to who has the most luck on the night.</p>
