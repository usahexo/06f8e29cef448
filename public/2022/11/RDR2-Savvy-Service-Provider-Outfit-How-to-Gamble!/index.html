This is a focused, beginner’s guide on how to make money through gambling. I will be discussing the many different ways to gamble in RDR2, as well as how best to use the savvy service provider outfit.</p>
<h2 id="Gambling-in-RDR2"><a href="#Gambling-in-RDR2" class="headerlink" title="Gambling in RDR2"></a>Gambling in RDR2</h2><p>There are a few ways to gamble in Red Dead Redemption 2. The first way is at the casino in Saint Denis. There are three games available at the casino - poker, blackjack and roulette. The second way to gamble is at saloons. There are two types of gambling available at saloons - card games and dice games. Finally, there is also a minigame available at general stores known as arm Wrestling. Let’s take a look at each of these gambling options in a bit more detail.</p>
<h3 id="Casino-Games"><a href="#Casino-Games" class="headerlink" title="Casino Games"></a>Casino Games</h3><p>The casino games are all pretty straightforward to play. In poker, you are playing against other players with the goal of having the best hand possible when all cards are revealed. In blackjack, you are trying to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, while still beating the dealer’s hand. In roulette, you are betting on which number the ball will land on after it’s spun around a wheel.</p>
<p>The important thing to know about all of these casino games is that the house always has an edge over players. This means that if you want to make money through gambling, you need to be smart about it and only bet what you can afford to lose. Otherwise, you may end up quickly losing your hard-earned cash.</p>
<h3 id="Saloon-card-games"><a href="#Saloon-card-games" class="headerlink" title="Saloon card games"></a>Saloon card games</h3><p>Saloon card games are pretty similar to poker - you are playing against other players with the goal of having the best hand possible when all cards are revealed. However, there are a few key differences between poker and saloon card games that you need to be aware of: firstly, most saloon card games use a deck with fewer cards than poker (28 instead of 52), and secondly, there is no bluffing in saloon card games - if you put in a bet, you must have a good hand or else you will lose your bet automatically. This means that if you don’t know what you’re doing, it’s easy to lose money very quickly in these games.</p>
<h3 id="Saloon-dice-games"><a href="#Saloon-dice-games" class="headerlink" title="Saloon dice games"></a>Saloon dice games</h3><p>Saloon dice games work differently from poker and saloon card games - rather than playing against other players, you are playing against the house itself (known as “The Dice Man”). Your goal is essentially to roll high numbers so that you can win back your bet plus an additional amount from The Dice Man. The important thing here is not to get too greedy - always leave yourself enough money so that you can continue playing even if you lose a couple of rounds in a row. That said, if you manage to roll big numbers consistently, then it’s easy to make some good money through these dice games!</p>
<h1 id="Get-the-RDR2-Savvy-Service-Provider-Outfit-and-Learn-How-to-Gamble-Like-a-Pro"><a href="#Get-the-RDR2-Savvy-Service-Provider-Outfit-and-Learn-How-to-Gamble-Like-a-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Get the RDR2 Savvy Service Provider Outfit and Learn How to Gamble Like a Pro!"></a>Get the RDR2 Savvy Service Provider Outfit and Learn How to Gamble Like a Pro!</h1><p>This guide is based on the RDR2 Savvy Service Provider Outfit. The Savvy Service Provider outfit can be found at any Tailor, and it costs $800.</p>
<p>The first step to gambling like a pro is to dress the part! The Savvy Service Provider outfit gives you a professional look that will help you fit in at the casino.</p>
<p>Once you have the outfit, it’s time to learn the basics of gambling. There are three basic types of bets - head-to-head, parlay and round robin.</p>
<p>Head-to-head is when you bet on two outcomes and choose which one you think will happen. If your pick wins, you get your money back plus your original bet multiplied by a set number - usually 2 or 3. If your pick loses, you lose your entire bet.</p>
<p>Parlay betting is when you combine two or more bets into one larger bet. If all of your picks win, you win an even larger payout than if each bet was made separately. However, if just one of your picks loses, you lose the entire bet.</p>
<p>Round robin betting is similar to parlay betting, but instead of combining different bets into one larger bet, you combine different groups of bets into one larger group of bets. For example, if you have three teams playing in a round robin tournament, you could make three separate head-to-head bets on each game (one for each team). If all three of your teams win, then you would win triple the amount that you would have won if each game was wagered on separately. However, if just one team loses, then you lose all three of your bets.</p>
<p>Now that you understand the basics of gambling, it’s time to start placing some bets! In general, I find that head-to-head bets are the best way to go because they offer the best odds and are the least risky. That said, there are certainly occasions when parlay or round robin betting can be profitable - especially when there’s a lot of value on offer from the bookmaker.</p>
<p>One final word of advice: always gamble with money that you can afford to lose! Gambling can be fun but it should never be viewed as a way to make money - if that’s what you’re looking for then I suggest investing in stocks or cryptocurrencies instead!</p>

<h1 id="How-to-Win-at-Gambling-in-Red-Dead-Redemption-2-with-the-Savvy-Service-Provider-Outfit"><a href="#How-to-Win-at-Gambling-in-Red-Dead-Redemption-2-with-the-Savvy-Service-Provider-Outfit" class="headerlink" title="How to Win at Gambling in Red Dead Redemption 2 with the Savvy Service Provider Outfit"></a>How to Win at Gambling in Red Dead Redemption 2 with the Savvy Service Provider Outfit</h1><p>Gambling can be a fun and lucrative way to pass the time in Red Dead Redemption 2, but it can also be risky. With the right outfit and strategies, you can tip the odds in your favor and come out ahead. The Savvy Service Provider outfit is perfect for gambling, as it provides a boost to your odds and gives you some helpful perks.</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll want to do is make sure you’re wearing the Savvy Service Provider outfit. This can be purchased from the Stables for $500. Once you have the outfit, equip it and head to any gambling location.</p>
<p>To increase your chances of winning, make sure to bet on the highest paying games. Gambling games are color-coded, with green being the best chance to win and red being the worst. The games with the best odds are usually horse races, followed by blackjack and poker. Avoid roulette and slots, as they have terrible odds.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with how to play blackjack or poker, there are plenty of guides online that can teach you how to play these games. Knowing how to play these games will give you a significant advantage over other players who don’t know how to play.</p>
<p>Another great way to increase your chances of winning is by using cheats. The “ dramatize “ cheat code can be used in blackjack and poker to make it easier for you to win. Simply enter “ dramatize “ while playing either game to get an advantage over your opponents.</p>
<p>Lastly, make sure to drink alcohol while gambling! Drinking will give you a “Drunk” bonus that increases your odds of winning by 10%. So next time you head to a saloon for a game of cards or dice, make sure you have a drink in hand!</p>
