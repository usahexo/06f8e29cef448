The game is scheduled to start at 6:00pm Central Standard Time and will be shown live on television in both the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Tottenham Hotspur, often referred to as Spurs, is a professional soccer club based in London, England. The club was founded in 1882 and has played continuously in the top division of English soccer since 1954. Spurs are one of eight founding members of the Premier League and have won the league title twice, in 1951 and 1961. They also reached the final of the Football Association (FA) Cup for the first time in 1991, losing 1-0 to rivals Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>Norwich City is an English professional soccer club based in Norwich, Norfolk. The club was formed in 1902 and joined the Premier League as a founding member in 1992. Norwich City reached their first major cup final in 1985, losing 3-1 to Everton in the FA Cup final. They also made it to the final of the League Cup two years later, but were defeated 2-0 by Liverpool.</p>
<p>This will be only the second meeting between Tottenham Hotspur FC and Norwich City. The first match took place on 15th September 2012 at Carrow Road, with Spurs winning 3-1 thanks to a Jermain Defoe hat-trick.</p>
<p>Tickets for Saturday’s match are still available through Ticketmaster starting at $30 each.</p>
<h1 id="Tottenham-Hotspur-FC-vs-Norwich-City-at-Riverspirit-Casino-Ballroom"><a href="#Tottenham-Hotspur-FC-vs-Norwich-City-at-Riverspirit-Casino-Ballroom" class="headerlink" title="Tottenham Hotspur FC vs. Norwich City at Riverspirit Casino Ballroom"></a>Tottenham Hotspur FC vs. Norwich City at Riverspirit Casino Ballroom</h1><p>Can Norwich City upset Premier League Tottenham Hotspur in their second preseason game? Tottenham Hotspur FC is coming off a strong 3-1 win against German side, Hertha Berlin. Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino fielded a strong side including new signings Tanguy Ndombele and Jack Clarke. However, they will be without injured stars Harry Kane and Dele Alli. Norwich City also had a solid preseason opener, defeating Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund 2-1 with both goals coming from Teemu Pukki.</p>
<p>Spurs are still the favorites in this matchup, but they cannot take Norwich lightly. The Canaries were one of the best teams in the Championship last season and will be looking to prove themselves against top Premier League opposition. With both teams likely to field strong lineups, this should be an exciting matchup to watch.</p>
<p>Where to Watch</p>
<p>The match will be shown live on Fox Sports 1 in the United States. If you can’t watch it on TV, you can also stream it online on FoxSports.com or the Fox Sports app. In the UK, the match will be shown on BBC One. If you’re not able to watch it on TV, you can listen to audio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live or BBC Sport website.</p>
<h1 id="Riverspirit-Casino-Ballroom-to-Host-Tottenham-Hotspur-FC-vs-Norwich-City"><a href="#Riverspirit-Casino-Ballroom-to-Host-Tottenham-Hotspur-FC-vs-Norwich-City" class="headerlink" title="Riverspirit Casino Ballroom to Host Tottenham Hotspur FC vs. Norwich City"></a>Riverspirit Casino Ballroom to Host Tottenham Hotspur FC vs. Norwich City</h1><p>Riverspirit Casino Ballroom will be hosting Tottenham Hotspur FC and Norwich City on Saturday, November 10 at 11:00 a.m. MT.</p>
<p>This match is sure to be an exciting one, as both teams are in the top half of the Premier League table. Tottenham Hotspur is currently in 5th place, while Norwich City is in 8th place.</p>
<p>This will only be the second time that Tottenham Hotspur has played in Boise, Idaho. The first time was in a preseason match against Real Salt Lake on July 17, 2013. That match ended in a 1-1 draw.</p>
<p>Norwich City is making its first visit to Boise.</p>
<p>Tickets for the match are available now at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.riverspirittickets.com/">www.riverspirittickets.com</a> . Prices start at $25 for general admission seating and go up to $75 for premium seating close to the action.</p>

And best of all, it’s right next to the casino! So you can enjoy some gambling and other fun activities after the match concludes.</p>
<h1 id="Spurs-Take-on-Norwich-in-a-Sold-Out-Game-at-Riverspirit-Casino-Ballroom"><a href="#Spurs-Take-on-Norwich-in-a-Sold-Out-Game-at-Riverspirit-Casino-Ballroom" class="headerlink" title="Spurs Take on Norwich in a Sold-Out Game at Riverspirit Casino Ballroom"></a>Spurs Take on Norwich in a Sold-Out Game at Riverspirit Casino Ballroom</h1><p>The San Antonio Spurs and the Norwich City Football Club will play an exhibition match on Saturday, July 20, at the Riverspirit Casino Ballroom in Worley, Idaho. The game is sold out.</p>
<p>The match is the final stop on the Spurs’ preseason tour of North America. They have already played games in Los Angeles and Mexico City.</p>
<p>Norwich is coming off a successful season that saw them finish 3rd in the English Premier League. In the EPL, only the top six teams qualify for postseason play.</p>
<p>Spurs coach Gregg Popovich is looking forward to the matchup. “Norwich had a great year last year and they’re a well coached team with a lot of good players,” he said. “It will be good for our guys to go against some different competition before we start our NBA season.”</p>
<p>The game will give Spurs fans a chance to see new players DeMar DeRozan and Jakob Poeltl in action. DeRozan was acquired in a trade with the Toronto Raptors earlier this month while Poeltl was drafted by San Antonio in June.</p>
<p>Spurs guard Manu Ginobili says he is excited to play in front of the home crowd in Idaho. “This will be my first time playing in Idaho and I’m really looking forward to it,” he said. “I’ve heard that the fans there are great and I can’t wait to see them cheering us on.”</p>

This match will be the first time that the English Premier League side has played in the state of Washington.</p>
<p>The club is coming off of a victory over Paris Saint-Germain on July 28th and will be looking for another win as they continue to prepare for their opening league match against Newcastle United on August 11th.</p>
<p>Manager Mauricio Pochettino is expected to rotate his squad for this match, giving some of his younger players a chance to show what they can do. One player who is likely to get some playing time is England international Harry Kane, who will be looking to score his first goal of the pre-season.</p>
<p>The Spurs have been busy this summer, signing Brazilian midfielder Lucas Moura from Paris Saint-Germain and Colombian defender Davinson Sanchez from Ajax Amsterdam. They have also brought in goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga from Southampton and defender Juan Foyth from Estudiantes.</p>
<p>The club is still looking to make some more additions before the end of the transfer window, with French midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia and Everton striker Wayne Rooney being two of their targets.</p>
<p>Tottenham Hotspur FC are set to take on Seattle Sounders FC on Tuesday, August 1st at 7:00 PM PST at the Riverspirit Casino Ballroom in Spokane, WA.</p>
