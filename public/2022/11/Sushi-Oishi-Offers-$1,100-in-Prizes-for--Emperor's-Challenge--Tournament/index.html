<p>The 1100th location is also notable because it features a completely redesigned interior and menu that offers more variety than ever before.

<p>“We are very excited to reach this milestone and celebrate with our fans across the country,” said Kane Wasabi, CEO of Sushi Oishi. “Our new menu offers something for everyone, and we’re looking forward to continue expanding our reach both domestically and abroad in 2019.”</p>
