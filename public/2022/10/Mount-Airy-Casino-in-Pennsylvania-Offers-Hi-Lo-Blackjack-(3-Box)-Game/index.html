The game offers a higher payout for blackjacks and pays out even money on all other bets.</p>
<p>In this game, the player plays against the dealer, who deals two cards to each player and himself. The player can hit, stand, double down, or split as normal. However, if the player gets a blackjack (an ace plus any 10-point card), they are paid 3:2 on their bet instead of the usual 1:1.</p>
<p>If the player busts (goes over 21), they lose their bet. If the dealer busts, all players at the table win even money on their bets. If both the player and dealer have the same total (a “push”), neither player nor dealer wins or loses and the wager is returned to the player.</p>

Why not try out Mount Airy Casino Resort’s Hi-Lo Blackjack game! This unique game is played with three decks of cards and offers players some great chances to win.</p>
<p>To begin, players are dealt two cards each and the goal is to reach 21 or come as close to 21 as possible. However, in Hi-Lo Blackjack, players can also choose to take a “hit” or “stand” depending on the hand they are dealt. If their cards total 11 or less, they should take a hit in order to try and get closer to 21. However, if their cards total 12 or more, they should stand since it’s likely they will bust if they hit again.</p>
<p>In addition, bettors can also choose to place an “ante” bet which is placed before any cards are drawn. This bet pays off based on the rank of the player’s first two cards - for example, a bettor who has an Ace and King as their first two cards would win even money on their ante bet. There is also a bonus payout for getting a blackjack (a Ten and Ace) which pays out 3:2 odds.</p>
<p>So why not try out Mount Airy Casino Resort’s Hi-Lo Blackjack game today? With some great odds and plenty of excitement, it’s definitely a must-try for any casino enthusiast!</p>
