Some are born with great arms while some achieve it through great efforts. If you are among those who want toned arms, then below are 10 tricks that can help speed up the process:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use light weights: When you are starting out, use light weights. This will help your muscles get used to the activity and also prevent any injuries.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do more repetitions: To tone up your arms faster, do more repetitions with lighter weights. This will help burn more calories and also tone your muscles.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use a mirror: This will help you keep track of your progress and see where you need to focus more in order to achieve the desired results faster.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change your routine: Don’t stick to the same routine all the time; change it up a bit every now and then. This will help keep your body from getting used to the exercises and also make the process more fun.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Vary your grip: Varying your grip will work different muscles in your arm and also lead to better results faster. For example, using a hammer grip will work your biceps more than using a traditional grip would.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take small breaks: Don’t try to do too much at once; take small breaks in between sets in order to allow your body time to recover and build muscle mass effectively.</p>
</li>
<li><p>use a weight belt: A weight belt can help add resistance and make the exercise harder, thus helping you tone up your arms faster.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>8 .Use elastic bands: Elastic bands can provide resistance as well; so, include them in your routine for even better results.</p>
<p>9 . target all areas of your arm : don’t just focus on one area; target all areas of your arm for better overall results. For example, do exercises that work on both the biceps and triceps for improved definition and tone .</p>
