The company is expected to gain some much-needed exposure in North America through its affiliation with Paris Saint-Germain. In turn, Paris Saint-Germain will enjoy increased revenues from merchandising and sponsorship opportunities. This new agreement could also help Platon capture a larger market share for its sports photography services.</p><p>Some experts are already predicting that the deal will make LeoVegas Casino the official betting partner of Paris Saint-Germain.

It is the tenth day of the Dhu al-Hijjah lunar month.</p><p>Eid al-Adha celebrates Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son Isaac, as God had commanded him. Muslims commemorate this story by sacrificing animals, usually sheep or cows, and giving some of the meat to the poor.</p><h1 id="What-is-the-Islamic-calendar"><a href="#What-is-the-Islamic-calendar" class="headerlink" title="What is the Islamic calendar?"></a>What is the Islamic calendar?</h1><p>The Islamic calendar, also known as the Hijri calendar, is a lunar calendar used by Muslims to mark religious occasions. It is based on the hijrah, or journey of the Prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Medina in 622 AD.</p><p>The Islamic calendar has 12 months, each lasting 29 or 30 days. The first month, Muharram, begins with the first sighting of the new moon. The remaining months are: Safar, Rabi’ al-awwal, Rabi’ ath-thani, Jumada al-ula’, Jumada al-akhirah, Rajab, Sha’ban, Ramadan, Shawwal and Dhu al-Qi’dah.</p><p>The Islamic year is 10 or 11 days shorter than the Gregorian year. This means that Islamic holidays fall at different times each year in relation to the Gregorian calendar. For example, Ramadan typically falls in late May or early June on the Gregorian calendar.</p><h1 id="How-do-Muslims-celebrate-Eid-al-Adha"><a href="#How-do-Muslims-celebrate-Eid-al-Adha" class="headerlink" title="How do Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha?"></a>How do Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha?</h1><p>The Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha is always celebrated on the tenth day of the Dhu al-Hijjah lunar month. For Muslims, this holiday commemorates Ibrahim’s willingness to sacrifice his son Ishmael as an act of obedience to God. Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha by attending special prayer services, exchanging gifts and blessings with family and friends, and slaughtering livestock in commemoration of Ibrahim’s sacrifice.</p><p>Many Muslims also take part in the tradition of Qurbani, which involves sacrificing a goat, sheep, cow or camel in memory of Ibrahim’s sacrifice. The meat from the Qurbani is usually distributed among friends, family members and the poor. In some cases, it is also saved for the time of Hajj, when Muslims are able to feast on the meat after completing the pilgrimage to Mecca.</p><h1 id="How-do-non-Muslims-celebrate-Eid-al-Adha"><a href="#How-do-non-Muslims-celebrate-Eid-al-Adha" class="headerlink" title="How do non-Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha?"></a>How do non-Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha?</h1><p>Non-Muslims may not be familiar with all the specifics of how Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha, but they can still join in on some of the festivities.

The holiday falls on the 10th day of the Islamic month Dhul-Hijjah and lasts for four days. It is one of the two most important holidays in Islam, the other being Eid al-Fitr.</p><p>On the first day of Eid al-Adha, Muslims attend a special prayer service known as Salat al-Eid. The prayers are followed by a sermon and then a celebration with food and family. Muslims are also encouraged to perform charitable deeds during Eid al-Adha. These include helping the poor and needy, feeding animals, and repairing roads and bridges.</p><p>The significance of Eid al-Adha comes from three main sources. The first is from Ibrahim’s story in the Quran. The second is from hadiths, which are oral traditions attributed to the Prophet Muhammad. And finally, there are scholarly opinions that look at both the Quran and hadiths to derive meaning.</p><p>One of the most famous stories from the Quran about Ibrahim is when Allah commands him to sacrifice his only son Ismael as an act of submission to Him. Ibrahim was willing to do anything for Allah, so he prepared to carry out Allah’s command. However, at the last moment Allah replaced Ismael with a ram, sparing his son’s life. This story represents how obedient Ibrahim was to Allah and how much he loved Him.</p><p>Eid al-Adha celebrates this story by commemorating Ibrahim’s willingness to give up everything for Allah—including his own son. Muslims celebrate this holiday by giving charity, praying together, and praising Allah for His blessings.</p><h1 id="What-are-some-of-the-traditions-associated-with-Eid-al-Adha"><a href="#What-are-some-of-the-traditions-associated-with-Eid-al-Adha" class="headerlink" title="What are some of the traditions associated with Eid al-Adha?"></a>What are some of the traditions associated with Eid al-Adha?</h1><p>The Eid al-Adha (Festival of Sacrifice) is a Muslim holiday that commemorates the willingness of Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son, Ishmael, as an act of obedience to God. It is one of the two most important holidays in the Islamic calendar, and it falls on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the 12th and final month of the Islamic lunar calendar.</p><p>Muslims typically celebrate Eid al-Adha by attending morning prayers at a mosque, followed by visits with family and friends. They may also enjoy special foods such as biryani or khichdi, or give charity to those in need. In many parts of the world, goats or sheep are sacrificed as part of this holiday celebration. The meat from the animals is usually divided into three parts: One for the family, one for friends and relatives, and one for the poor and needy.</p><h1 id="What-are-some-things-you-can-do-to-celebrate-Eid-al-Adha"><a href="#What-are-some-things-you-can-do-to-celebrate-Eid-al-Adha" class="headerlink" title="What are some things you can do to celebrate Eid al-Adha?"></a>What are some things you can do to celebrate Eid al-Adha?</h1><p>There are many things you can do to celebrate Eid al-Adha.
