The Riverspirit Casino Ballroom in Tulsa, Oklahoma will be the scene of an English Premier League soccer match on Saturday, February 22nd as Tottenham Hotspur FC takes on Norwich City. The game is scheduled to start at 6:00pm Central Standard Time and will be shown live on television in both the United States and the United Kingdom.

Tottenham Hotspur, often referred to as Spurs, is a professional soccer club based in London, England. The club was founded in 1882 and has played continuously in the top division of English soccer since 1954. Spurs are one of eight founding members of the Premier League and have won the league title twice, in 1951 and 1961. They also reached the final of the Football Association (FA) Cup for the first time in 1991, losing 1-0 to rivals Nottingham Forest.

Norwich City is an English professional soccer club based in Norwich, Norfolk. The club was formed in 1902 and joined the Premier League as a founding member in 1992. Norwich City reached their first major cup final in 1985, losing 3-1 to Everton in the FA Cup final. They also made it to the final of the League Cup two years later, but were defeated 2-0 by Liverpool.

This will be only the second meeting between Tottenham Hotspur FC and Norwich City. The first match took place on 15th September 2012 at Carrow Road, with Spurs winning 3-1 thanks to a Jermain Defoe hat-trick.

Tickets for Saturday’s match are still available through Ticketmaster starting at $30 each.

Can Norwich City upset Premier League Tottenham Hotspur in their second preseason game? Tottenham Hotspur FC is coming off a strong 3-1 win against German side, Hertha Berlin. Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino fielded a strong side including new signings Tanguy Ndombele and Jack Clarke. However, they will be without injured stars Harry Kane and Dele Alli. Norwich City also had a solid preseason opener, defeating Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund 2-1 with both goals coming from Teemu Pukki.

Spurs are still the favorites in this matchup, but they cannot take Norwich lightly. The Canaries were one of the best teams in the Championship last season and will be looking to prove themselves against top Premier League opposition. With both teams likely to field strong lineups, this should be an exciting matchup to watch.

The match will be shown live on Fox Sports 1 in the United States.
