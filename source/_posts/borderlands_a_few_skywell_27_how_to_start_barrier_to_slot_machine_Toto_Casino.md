# Borderlands 3: Skywell-27 - How to Access the Barrier and the Slot Machine

Borderlands 3 is an action-packed first-person shooter game that has taken the world by storm. One of the exciting features of the game is the slot machine, which can help players earn some extra cash and valuable loot. The Skywell-27 location in Borderlands 3 offers both the slot machine and the barrier, which can be accessed by players looking to progress further in the game. In this article, we'll explain how to access both the barrier and the slot machine in Skywell-27.

## Accessing the Barrier

The barrier in Skywell-27 is an energy field that blocks players from progressing further in the game. To access the barrier, players must first complete the Atlas, At Last mission, which is part of the game's main story. Once the mission is complete, players can access the barrier by travelling to the Skywell-27 location.

When players arrive at Skywell-27, they will need to activate the console to lower the barrier. The console is located on the left side of the barrier and can be easily spotted by the player. Once the console is activated, the barrier will lower, allowing players to progress further in the game.

## Accessing the Slot Machine

The slot machine in Skywell-27 is located just behind the barrier, and players can access it once the barrier has been lowered. To get to the slot machine, players need to head to the left side of the barrier and jump up onto the platform. From there, players can follow the path until they reach the slot machine.

Once players have reached the slot machine, they can start playing by inserting cash into the machine. The slot machine in Skywell-27 offers players the chance to win cash and valuable loot, making it a popular spot for players looking to boost their in-game resources.

## Conclusion

Accessing the barrier and the slot machine in Skywell-27 can be a challenge for players who are new to the game. However, with the right strategy and some practice, players can easily unlock both features and progress further in the game. Remember to complete the Atlas, At Last mission to access the barrier, and head to the left side of the barrier to access the slot machine. Good luck, Vault Hunter!
