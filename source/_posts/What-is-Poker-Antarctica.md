#  What is Poker Antarctica?

The poker game that is played in Antarctica, often called Poker Antarctica, is a unique twist on the classic game. Played with a deck of 52 cards and two jokers, the game is a variation of Texas hold 'em.

To start the game, each player is dealt five cards face down. The player to the left of the dealer starts the betting round by either betting, raising, or folding. Play then proceeds clockwise around the table.

After the first betting round, three cards are turned face up in the middle of the table. These are called the flop. Another betting round takes place, and then a fourth card (the turn) is revealed. A final betting round happens before the fifth and final card (the river) is shown. The player who has the best five-card hand using their two hole cards and three of the community cards wins the pot.

Poker Antarctica can be a very exciting game, especially when there's a lot of money at stake. With so much on the line, it's important to make calculated decisions and play smart poker!
