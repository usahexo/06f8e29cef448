#  What are the different types of bets that I can make at 22bet?

22bet offers a comprehensive range of betting options for its customers, from the simple to the complex. Whether you're looking to bet on a football match or try your luck on the casino floor, 22bet has something to offer everyone. In this article, we'll take a look at some of the most popular types of bets that you can make at 22bet.

# Single bets

The simplest type of bet is the single bet. As the name suggests, this is a wager on a single event, such as who will win a particular football match or how many points will be scored in a tennis game. Single bets are perfect for those who want to keep things simple and don't want to worry about combining several different bets into one.

# Multiples

If you're feeling more adventurous, you can try your hand at multiples betting. This involves combining two or more bets into one single wager. For example, you could combine two bets on different football matches to create a 'double'. Or you could even bet on three or four matches happening simultaneously in order to form a 'treble' or 'quadrella'. Multiples betting can give you the chance to win big payouts if all of your selections come through, but it's also risky so make sure you know what you're doing!

# Future bets

Another popular type of bet is the future bet. This involves predicting how an event will play out at some point in the future, often well beyond the date of the actual event itself. For example, you might place a future bet on which team will win next year's Premier League title. Future bets can be great fun to place and can offer some very lucrative payouts if everything goes your way. However, they can also be tricky to get right so make sure you do your research before placing any wagers!

# Specials

Finally, we have specials betting. This is where bookmakers like 22bet offer odds on events that aren't necessarily related to sport. For example, you might be able to place a wager on who will be the next President of the United States or whether Brexit will actually happen in 2019. Specials betting can be great fun and can offer some interesting insights into current affairs, but do make sure you're aware of all the possible outcomes before placing any money down!
