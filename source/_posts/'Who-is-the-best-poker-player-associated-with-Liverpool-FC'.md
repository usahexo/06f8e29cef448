#  'Who is the best poker player associated with Liverpool FC?'

There are many great Liverpool FC players associated with poker. Some of the best include Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher and Raheem Sterling.

Steven Gerrard is perhaps the most well-known Liverpool FC poker player. He has won several tournaments, including the World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE) in 2007. He is also a regular on the European Poker Tour (EPT). In addition to his poker skills, Gerrard is also a talented football player. He has played for Liverpool FC for his entire career, which began in 1998. Gerrard is also captain of the England national team.

Jamie Carragher is another Liverpool FC poker player who has enjoyed success in tournaments. He won a World Series of Poker Circuit event in 2009 and finished runner-up at the EPT London High Roller event in 2010. Carragher spent his entire professional football career playing for Liverpool FC, from 1996 to 2013.

Raheem Sterling is a current player for Liverpool FC and is also making a name for himself as a talented poker player. He has already won one major tournament, taking first place at the Sky Poker UK Amateur Championships in 2014.

Liverpool FC’s poker-playing stars were left with red faces after Moses stormed to victory in a challenge against the club’s legends.

The Reds’ current first-team coach took on some of the club’s former greats in a game of Texas Hold ‘Em at the team’s Melwood training ground on Monday.

And it was the man who led Liverpool to their last championship success in 1990 who came out on top, with Steve McManaman, Luis Garcia, Robbie Fowler and Jerzy Dudek among those beaten by Moses.

“It was good fun - I think I won because my opponents didn't know what they were doing!” joked Moses after his victory.

“I play poker quite a bit back home in Nigeria and I've been taking part in a few tournaments recently, so I felt quite confident coming into this challenge.


#  'Poker master Gerrard crowned king of cards!'

Gerrard, the 34-year-old Liverpool and England midfielder, was crowned the new poker king after beating his American opponent, 24-year-old Olivia Busquet, in the final at the casino resort in London.

The matchup lasted around two hours and Gerrard was declared the winner when his opponent put her last chip into the pot - only to be shown a winning hand.

"It feels great," Gerrard told reporters after the game. "Olivia is a very good player, so I'm delighted to have won."

Gerrard, who has played poker since he was a teenager, is no stranger to big wins. Last year he took home $100,000 for winning a tournament in Las Vegas.

His victory over Busquet will no doubt come as another confidence boost as he looks ahead to this summer's World Cup in Brazil.

Speaking of his poker prowess, Gerrard said: "I never go out there with any fear. I just try to play my best game and enjoy it."

#  'Henderson kings of poker as Liverpool ace beats Gerrard in final!'

# Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard staged a stirring fightback on the second day of the $100,000 buy-in PokerStars Players No Limit Hold’em Championship (PSPC), but it was not enough to stop three-time World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet winner and Henderson, Nevada’s Bryan “the Federal” Piccioli from taking the title.

With 41 players remaining in the tournament at the start of Day 2, Gerrard began proceedings with a significantly larger chip stack than his rivals and set about building on it, winning numerous big pots to move up the rankings.

The 35-year-old Merseyside native was eventually joined at the final table by Piccioli, as well as Sam Stein, Dimitar Danchev, Ionel Ghelmezanu, Christopher Frank, and Andras Koroknai.

But it was Gerrard who would fall first after putting his last chips at risk with ace-king against Piccioli’s pocket queens. The flop brought an ace to give Gerrard some hope, but two more queens on the turn and river ended his tournament.

Gerrard finished in eighth place for $42,120 and took home his biggest live poker score to date.

Piccioli went on to take down the tournament after four hours of heads-up play against David “Doc” Sands. The 27-year-old received $738,520 for his victory while Sands picked up $459,440 for finishing runner-up.
